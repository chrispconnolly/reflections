When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This would be useful when you don't want to keep a local copy.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This will give you more control over what you pull into your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are repo copies on GitHub.  Clones are local repo copies.  Branches are copies that have been modified and committed seperate from the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
This way you can test your changes against the latest shared branch before committing.
