When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This would be useful when you don't want to keep a local copy.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This will give you more control over what you pull into your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are repo copies on GitHub.  Clones are local repo copies.  Branches are copies that have been modified and committed seperate from the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
This way you can test your changes against the latest shared branch before committing.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would use a different source control tool such as SVN.  If one was not available, probably email.  All changes would need to be checked and de-conflicted manually and we'd likely lose some changes on occasion.  Check-ins would be easier but QA would be way harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
If you are working on a larger or a risky feature, it's a good idea to use a seperate branch.  A feature that is not part of the current release requirements is also a good candidate for a seperate branch.
